"""
main.py — FastAPI Gateway Server
----------------------------------
This is the main entry point for the gateway service. It sits between the outside
world and vLLM, adding:

  1. API key authentication        (via auth.py)
  2. Per-IP rate limiting          (via slowapi)
  3. Request ID tracing            (UUID attached to every request for log correlation)
  4. Structured access logs        (JSON, via middleware.py logger)
  5. Prometheus metrics            (counters/histograms, via middleware.py metrics)
  6. Streaming support             (SSE pass-through for real-time token delivery)

Traffic flow:
  Client → Gateway (:8080) → vLLM (:8000) → GPU → vLLM → Gateway → Client

The gateway speaks the OpenAI API format, so any client written against OpenAI's
API works here without modification (just change the base URL and API key).
"""

import time
# time.time() gives the current Unix timestamp in seconds (float).
# We record it at request start and subtract at request end to get latency.

import uuid
# uuid.uuid4() generates a random 128-bit identifier, formatted as a string like:
# "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000". Used as a unique request ID for log tracing.

import httpx
# httpx is an async HTTP client — like the requests library, but async-compatible.
# We use it to forward requests from the gateway to vLLM.
# "async" here means the gateway can handle many other requests while waiting
# for vLLM to respond — it doesn't block a thread.

from contextlib import asynccontextmanager
# asynccontextmanager lets us define async setup/teardown logic using "async with".
# We use it to create the httpx client once at server startup and close it at shutdown,
# rather than creating a new HTTP connection for every request (expensive).

from fastapi import FastAPI, Request, Depends, HTTPException
# FastAPI: the web framework. Handles routing, validation, OpenAPI docs generation.
# Request: gives us access to the raw incoming HTTP request (headers, body, client IP).
# Depends: declares a dependency — FastAPI will call the dependency function first
#          and inject its return value into your endpoint function.
# HTTPException: raises an HTTP error response and stops processing the current request.

from fastapi.responses import StreamingResponse, JSONResponse
# StreamingResponse: sends the response body incrementally (chunk by chunk) instead
#   of buffering the entire response first. Essential for LLM streaming (SSE) where
#   you want to show tokens as they are generated rather than waiting for completion.
# JSONResponse: sends a complete JSON body with a given status code. Used for
#   non-streaming responses and error messages.

from prometheus_client import make_asgi_app
# make_asgi_app() creates a small ASGI (async web app) that serves Prometheus metrics
# at /metrics in the text exposition format that Prometheus scrapes.
# We mount it as a sub-application inside FastAPI.

from slowapi import Limiter
# slowapi is a rate-limiting library built for FastAPI/Starlette.
# It uses decorators on endpoint functions to enforce request rate limits.

from slowapi.util import get_remote_address
# get_remote_address: a function that extracts the caller's IP address from the request.
# We use this as the "key" for rate limiting — limits are applied per IP address.

from slowapi.errors import RateLimitExceeded
# RateLimitExceeded: the exception slowapi raises when a client exceeds their rate limit.
# We register a custom handler for this exception below to return a clean JSON 429 response.

from pydantic import BaseModel
# Pydantic is FastAPI's data validation layer. You define the shape of your request body
# as a Python class inheriting from BaseModel. FastAPI automatically:
#   - Parses the incoming JSON body
#   - Validates field types and constraints
#   - Returns a 422 Unprocessable Entity error with details if validation fails
# This means we never need to manually parse or validate request JSON.

from typing import Optional, List
# Optional[X] means the field can be X or None (absent).
# List[X] means a list of X objects. Used for the messages array in chat requests.

import os
# Read environment variables (VLLM_URL, RATE_LIMIT_RPM) set in docker-compose.yml.

from auth import verify_api_key
# Import our API key validator from auth.py. Used as a dependency on the chat endpoint.

from middleware import (

    GATEWAY_RATE_LIMITED
)
# Import the logger and all Prometheus metric objects defined in middleware.py.


# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration — read from environment variables
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# These are set in docker-compose.yml under the gateway service's "environment" block.
# os.getenv(key, default) returns the env var value or the default if not set.
VLLM_URL = os.getenv("VLLM_URL", "http://localhost:8000")
# vLLM runs on the same machine, reached at localhost:8000.

RATE_LIMIT = os.getenv("RATE_LIMIT_RPM", "60")
# Requests per minute allowed per IP. Configurable without code changes.


# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Rate Limiter Initialization
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Limiter(key_func=get_remote_address) creates a rate limiter that tracks
# request counts per client IP address. The actual limit value is applied
# per-endpoint via the @limiter.limit() decorator below.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Application Lifespan — startup and shutdown logic
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The @asynccontextmanager decorator turns this into an async context manager.
# FastAPI's lifespan parameter accepts this pattern to run code:
#   - BEFORE the server starts accepting requests (setup)
#   - AFTER the server stops (teardown)
#
# Why manage the HTTP client here instead of creating it per-request?
# httpx.AsyncClient maintains a connection pool — reusing TCP connections to vLLM
# instead of doing a full TCP handshake on every request. This significantly reduces
# latency, especially under load.
@asynccontextmanager

    # before declaring a timeout. This is stored on app.state so all request handlers
    # can access it via request.app.state.http_client.
